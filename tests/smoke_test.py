"""Smoke test for the sample solve.

Runs solver.py against the committed sample data and checks that it finds an
OPTIMAL schedule and writes the output files. Stdlib only, so CI needs no test
framework:

    python tests/smoke_test.py

The assertions are pytest-compatible too, if you happen to have pytest:
