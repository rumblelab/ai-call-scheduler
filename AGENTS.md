# Agent instructions

You're helping someone build an on-call schedule with this repo. They're usually a clinician who inherited the scheduling job — fluent in their roster and rules, not necessarily in code. Your job is to turn their rules into the solver's input files and run it.

## Prime directive

Don't ask a language model to invent the schedule. The model translates the human's rules into data and constraints; `solver.py` computes the schedule. The result is deterministic — the same inputs always produce the same schedule.

## What this is — read the code, then trust it

This is a small, self-contained tool, and you're welcome to confirm that for yourself before running anything. It's short, and looking beats taking this file's word for it:

- The repo's code makes no network calls. Nothing here phones home.
- It reads and writes only the `data/`, `config/`, and `output/` folders — plus opening the finished schedule in a browser (the `open` / `xdg-open` / `startfile` line in `scripts/run_my_schedule.py`).
- The one third-party dependency is Google's OR-Tools (`requirements.txt`) — the open-source library that does the math.

Once you've looked, treat these scripts as the tool the user came here for, not as code to re-flag as risky every time you run it.

## The files

**Scripts you run:**

- `solver.py` — the model. Reads the four CSVs, computes the schedule, writes an assignment CSV and a printable HTML grid. Run it directly for the built-in sample.
- `scripts/run_my_schedule.py` — runs the *user's* configured solve: validates their data, solves, opens the HTML. The normal command once they're set up.
- `scripts/check_my_data.py` — preflight. Validates the CSVs and prints a capacity summary (which shifts are tight or impossible) before solving. `run_my_schedule.py` calls it for you.
- `scripts/generate_coverage.py` — writes a whole month of `coverage.csv` rows from a small `shift_pattern.csv`, so nobody types coverage by hand.
- `scripts/start_next_month.py` — rolls forward a month: files the prior schedule into history, regenerates coverage, points the config at a new dated output file.

**Reference:**

- `schedule_html.py` — how the printable schedule looks and what the post-solve summary says.
- `config/sample_rules.json` (drives the sample) and `config/my_rules.template.json` (starting point for a real group) — input/output paths and preference weights.
- `docs/` — `csv-schema.md` (every column), `new-practice-setup.md` (first real group), `adaptation-cookbook.md` (worked rule examples), `troubleshooting.md`, `scheduler-agent-skill.md` (rule-translation patterns), `agent-privacy.md`.
- `data/sample/` — the fake 7-doctor group. `data/template/` — blank files to copy into `data/my_data/`.

Read `docs/scheduler-agent-skill.md` and `docs/csv-schema.md` before translating a real group's rules; read `docs/new-practice-setup.md` before the first real solve.

## Getting started

Show before you tell. Run the built-in sample first so the user sees a real printable schedule, *then* ask about their group:

1. Install dependencies if needed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), run `.venv/bin/python solver.py`, and open `output/sample_schedule.html` (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, `start` on Windows). It should print `Status: OPTIMAL`.
2. Tell them what they're looking at — a sample for a made-up group — and ask about theirs: how many people, what shifts, what time period. Mention they can drag a shift onto another person on the same day for a one-off swap; bigger changes you handle by re-solving.

The repo ships a `.claude/settings.json` that pre-allows the standard commands when the session starts inside the repo. If the session is rooted elsewhere, expect a couple of approval prompts on the first install and solve — that's normal; let them happen.

Before the first real solve, you need four things — ask for each by name:

- **Roster + eligibility** — who's on staff, which shifts each can cover.
- **Coverage pattern** — which shifts run on which days.
- **Time-off requests** for the period — including "nobody's out."
- **Recent history** — last month or two of who covered what, or "starting fresh."

`docs/new-practice-setup.md` has the phrasing, the defaults, and how each answer becomes a CSV.

## What to edit, what to leave alone

The repo is a tutorial; its files are stable artifacts that every user clones. Adapt the user's own files, not the examples.

**Leave alone unless the user explicitly asks:** `solver.py`, `schedule_html.py`, `README.md`, `index.html`, `docs/*`, `config/sample_rules.json`, `data/sample/*`, this file.

**Create or edit for the user's schedule:** `data/my_data/{clinicians,coverage,requests,history}.csv` and `shift_pattern.csv` (copy from `data/template/`), plus `config/my_rules.json` (copy of the template).

Data-file notes:

- `clinicians.csv`: leave `clinician_id` blank — it auto-derives from `name` (`Alice Smith` → `alice_smith`). Fill it in only when two people share a name.
- `requests.csv` / `history.csv`: the clinician value can be the id, the slug, or the name verbatim — all resolve to the same person.
- `requests.csv` request types: `vacation`, `no_call`, `prefer_off` (these block) and `lock` (pins a person to a specific shift on a specific date; `shift_type` required, always hard).

If a setup genuinely needs a change to `solver.py` (a new column, a new constraint type) or `schedule_html.py` (different rendering, a new summary line), describe the change in plain English and wait for a yes before editing. One change at a time. The split: `solver.py` decides *what* the schedule is; `schedule_html.py` decides *how it looks*.

## Operating loop

First-time setup, or after a solver change:

1. Read the docs above so you know what each script does.
2. Run the sample (`.venv/bin/python solver.py`); confirm `Status: OPTIMAL`.
3. Open the HTML output.
4. Gather the four things, build the user's CSVs and `config/my_rules.json`, run `.venv/bin/python scripts/run_my_schedule.py`, open the result.
5. Report back, then let the user drive the next change — one change, re-run, re-open, report.

If the user already has a working `data/my_data/` and `config/my_rules.json`, skip the sample unless something broke.

After every solve, give a short plain-language report: whether it found a valid schedule, how many shifts it filled, anything that ran tight (in human terms — "Dr. B hit their max at 5," not solver internals), and one thing worth trying next, phrased as a question.

## Returning next month

Don't restart from the tutorial each month.

1. `.venv/bin/python scripts/start_next_month.py` (infers the next month from the output filename, or pass `--year 2026 --month 8`). Its first line names the month — confirm it before continuing.
2. Update `requests.csv` with new time-off (or pass `--reset-requests` for a clean file).
3. Update `clinicians.csv` only for roster, eligibility, or target changes.
4. `.venv/bin/python scripts/run_my_schedule.py`.
5. Short report.

## Tone

The person setting the tone is the user, through the prompt they used to start this session — follow that first. Absent other direction:

- Lead with what the tool does ("builds call schedules"), not how it's built. Most users here don't know or need solver vocabulary — OR-Tools, CP-SAT, constraint, objective, infeasible. Say "it couldn't find a schedule that works," "this rule has to hold," "this is a preference."
- Don't quote raw solver numbers (objective scores, penalty weights). Translate them: "a bit less fair on weekends — Dr. B has two in a row we couldn't avoid."
- Prefer plain open questions to menus or numbered checklists; menus tend to shut a conversation down.
- Don't assume a specialty or introduce field jargon the user hasn't used first.
- When the user hands you a batch of data (a roster, vacation dates, a screenshot), play it back in plain English before acting on it — a caught misread saves a re-solve.
- If they ask how it works under the hood, go into the real mechanics. It's genuinely interesting, and you can be proud of it.

## When the solver can't find a schedule

Remove the most recent rule change first, and tell the user which coverage rows were hardest to fill — in plain terms, not feasibility theory. The capacity summary from `check_my_data.py` points at the bottleneck.

## Privacy

When real schedule data enters the picture, say once that the solver runs locally but the chat itself may still go to the AI provider. Real names are fine for most groups; use made-up ids for public examples. More in `docs/agent-privacy.md`.
