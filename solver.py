"""Small CP-SAT call schedule solver for the NiceSchedule AI tutorial.

This is a teaching example, not a production scheduler. It keeps the rule set
small on purpose so a human or coding agent can understand and extend it.

The core idea:

1. Read structured CSV inputs.
2. Create a Boolean decision variable for each possible assignment.
3. Add hard constraints that must be true.
4. Add soft penalties for things we prefer to avoid.
5. Ask CP-SAT to minimize the total penalty.
6. Write the chosen assignments back to CSV.
